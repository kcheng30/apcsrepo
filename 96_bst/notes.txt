DISCO:
* Easy to write recursion once base case is identified.
* Make sure to keep track of what you return (have to return an int vs TreeNode)
* Dont forget to draw your tree first!! 

QCC:
* How to print value of a TreeNode returned for a value not found in tree? Set value upon initialization to 0?
  Or just settle with printing null?
* We should probably override the current print statement to print the value of the node because
we can not do getValue() for a null node.
