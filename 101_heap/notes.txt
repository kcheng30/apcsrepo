HW101: Heap o'Trouble
2022-05-16T
time spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
* The remove algo of BST doesn't work with heaps because there's no guarantee that the children of a node will be greater than their "uncle/aunt" 
* Instead, we chose to use a recursive approach with remove that would have worked with BST as well, but might not be as efficient because of all the switcherooing
* BST is no heap, it does not have a consistent key ):< 
* Values do not go in any specific side of the tree like in a BST but it is still left justified 
QCC: 
* Would it be possible to have multiple of the same value in one tree? (probably yes but)
* How to prevent an add algo that just causes a heavily skewed tree? 
* Our algo makes our tree very line ): ):
