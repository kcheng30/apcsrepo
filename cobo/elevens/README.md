This lab was mostly smooth, and it made sense. The GUI for the elevens game was nice and made this lab more interactive. Activity 5 was the biggest problem because the buggy folders were missing a Deck.java file, and when we pasted in the Deck.java we implemented, the assertions kinda just didn't do anything. We also tried using the Deck.java file from later activities, and still we got no errors.
