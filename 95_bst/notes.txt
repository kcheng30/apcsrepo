HW95: Algorithm as Data Structure

time spent: 1 hrs

DISCO: 
* The order in which you put how you process the left, right, and self matter a lot to each traversal method
* BTS??
* Once we wrote the algo for one of the prints, it got a lot easier to write the algos 
  for the other two prints because they all follow the same basic recursion pattern except 
  with different processing order. 
* Helpful to use diagnostic print statements and go through each step of code by hand. 
QCC:
* set root value to 0 or set root as null?
* 

With L = level, d = depth, h = height
1) a perfect binary tree has _____ nodes
   (2^h) + (2^(h-1))+ ... + (2^0)
2) at each level, a perfect binary tree has _____ nodes
  2^h 
3) height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is _____
  (L - 1)
