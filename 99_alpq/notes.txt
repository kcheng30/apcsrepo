HW99: Some Are More Equal Than Others, Codified

time spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
- ints are ordered from greatest to least because of the add method. It is easier to treat 0 as the highest prio because you know it is the absolute lowest. 
- We should not remove from the front of the array because that would require everything to shift over. That is why the highest prio goes to the back of the list,
where peekMin will show the highest prio in the list and also the last element in the list.

QCC:
- What if we are putting other data types in the ArrayList?
- Use of compareTo method and overwriting it in order to implement priority arraylist with custom objects?
