0. The base of a number system is how many symbols that can represent values for that number system in each digit place. For example, in base 10, better known as decimal,
   there are ten different symbols (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) that represent different values in every decimal place in the number. In addition, just like how there are tens
   and hundreds and more decimal places, there are x^1 and x^2 digit places and more for a number in base x.

1. Binary is base 2, and usually you will see numbers written in binary with 1 and 0s. The binary number system is important because there are only two values: having only
   0s or 1s is the same as having a true or false system, which is very simple to replicate with the presence or absense of an electrical signal in a computer transistor.

2. First, starting from the leftmost digit, add it into a number which will be called the "total sum". Multiply the total sum by 2 and then add the digit to the right. 
   Keep repeating the step in the previous sentence until you have added every digit in the binary number. 

   The process should look similar to this:

     100111010: 1
	   *2 + 0 (the subsequent digit) = 2
	   *2 + 0 = 4
	   *2 + 1 = 9
	   *2 + 1 = 19
	   *2 + 1 = 39
	   *2 + 0 = 68
	   *2 + 1 = 137
	   *2 + 0 = 274, stop

   Therefore, 100111010 in binary is equal to 272 in decimal.

3. First, check if the decimal number is equal to 0 mod 2 or 1 mod 2. If the number is 0 mod 2, record the 0 and divide the decimal by 2. If the number is 1 mod 2, record a
   1, subtract the number by 1 and then divide by 2. For subsequent repetitions of the process, record the 0 or 1 to the left of the digits you are recording. Repeat the
   previous steps until the decimal number is equal to 0.

   The process should look similar to this:

	274 = 0 mod 2, 272/2 = 137, record 0
	137 = 1 mod 2, 136/2 = 68, record 10
	68 = 0 mod 2, 68/2 = 39, record 010
	39 = 1 mod 2, 38/2 = 19, record 1010
	19 = 1 mod 2, 18/2 = 9, record 11010
	9 = 1 mod 2, 8/2 = 4, record 111010
	4 = 0 mod 2, 4/2 = 2, record 0111010
	2 = 0 mod 2, 2/2 = 1, record 00111010
	1 = 1 mod 2, 0/2 = 0, record 100111010, stop
