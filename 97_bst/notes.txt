HW97: Prune Your Tree
2022-05-11r
time spent: 1 hrs


DISCO:
* It is possible to set a node equal to null... 
* Diagramming is key, but it also helps to get ideas across to teammates
  ALGORITHM
  - Base cases are a node with no children or one child
  - To remove a node with two children, traverse tree until
    the greatest node on the left subtree is found. 
    Replace the root node's value with that greatest value.
  - If said greatest node has a left child, replace that greatest node's value 
    with the child's value
  
  
QCC:
* piggybacking? how to incorporate in our code to prevent nodes from getting lost??
  or to keep track of front/back??
* Why trees exist im allergic to trees alas how ironic ;-; (im allergic to tree pollen fr)
* ?? recursive? or iterative using while loop??
* how to treat replacing a greatest left subtree node with a left child
